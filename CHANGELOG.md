## 3.0.0
__19.12.2021__

- Implemented new interface-based entity model.
  > All concrete implementations of entities are now hidden behind interfaces which exports only behavior which is
  > intended for end developer usage. For example: User is now not exported and its interface `IUser` is available for developers.
  > This change shouldn't have impact of end developers.
- Improved handling autocomplete
  > Autocomplete can be now registered in CommandOptionBuilder. This allows registering multiple autocomplete handler for options
  > with same names.
- Fixed bugs with registering commands and command permissions. This feature should now work flawlessly.
- Fix critical bug preventing commands from being registered
- Fix #10

Other changes are initial implementation of unit and integration tests to assure correct behavior of internal framework
processes. Also added `Makefile` with common commands that are run during development.
